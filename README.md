This document describes the TREC Slack instance.  For information on TREC, go to https://trec.nist.gov/.  For a historical perspective, you can read the TREC book from MIT press, available at https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/trec.

TREC uses Slack for communications among active participants in TREC.  The #general channel is available for general comments and questions.  There will be track-specific channels for each track, much as tracks have used mailing lists in the past.

Discussion on track and participant channels is only for TREC participants.  You can register to participate in TREC by responding to the Call For Participation when it comes out in December.  Please consider keeping as much planning and organization as possible on the track channel, as a way of encouraging people to register to participate.

"TREC-private" information, such as the active participants password, will be deleted from the Slack.  Please do not post this kind of information.
