This document describes the TREC Slack instance.  For information on TREC, go to https://trec.nist.gov/.  For a historical perspective, you can read the TREC book from MIT press, available at https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/trec.

TREC is trying out Slack for communications for TREC 2019.  The #general channel will remain open to anyone.  There will be track-specific channels for each track, as well as a general participant channel, and those will be open to TREC participants, much as tracks have used mailing lists in the past.

Discussion on track and participant channels is only for TREC participants.  You can register to participate in TREC by responding to the Call For Participation when it comes out in December 2018 or January 2019.  Please consider keeping as much planning and organization as possible on the track channel, as a way of encouraging people to register to participate.

"TREC-private" information, such as the active participants password, will be deleted from the Slack.  Please do not post this kind of information.
